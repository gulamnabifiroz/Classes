# Classes

<br> <p align="center"> <strong>Experiment No 11A</strong> </p>

## Aim

To create a C++ program that stores and displays information about students using a class.

## Software Used

- Dev C++

## Theory

In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that allows you to bundle related data and functions into a single unit. This encapsulation of data makes it easier to manage and manipulate data objects. In this program, we define a Student class to store information about students, including their name, age, and year of birth.
<br>

### Key Concepts

Class: A class in C++ is a blueprint for creating objects (instances of that class). It can contain data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) to operate on the data.
<br>
Object: An instance of a class. Each object has its own values for the data members defined in the class.
<br>
Data Members: Variables that store the state of an object. In this program, name, age, and year are data members of the Student class.
<br>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start
<br>
Step 2: Define a class Student with the following data members:
<br>
name: A string to store the student's name.
<br>
age: A float to store the student's age.
<br>
year: An integer to store the student's year of birth.
<br>
Step 3: Create two objects of the Student class, S1 and S2.
<br>
Step 4: Assign values to the name, age, and year data members for each object.
<br>
Step 5: Display the values of name, age, and year for both students.
<br>
Step 6: Stop
<br>

## Conclusion

In this experiment, we created a C++ program to store and display information about students using a class. We learned how to define a class, create objects, and assign and display values for the data members of these objects.

## Aim

To create a C++ program that uses a class to store student details and display them using a member function.

## Software Used

- Dev C++

## Theory

In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for objects. A class contains data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) that operate on the data. This program uses a class named Student to encapsulate the details of a student, such as name, age, and year of birth. The member function mymethod() is used to display the information stored in the object.

### Key Concepts:

Class and Object: A class is a blueprint, while an object is an instance of that class.
<br>
Encapsulation: Bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).

<br>
name: A string to store the student's name.
<br>
age: A float to store the student's age.
<br>
year: An integer to store the student's year of birth.
<br>
Step 3: Create two objects of the Student class, S1 and S2.
<br>
Step 4: Assign values to the name, age, and year data members for each object.
<br>
Step 5: Display the values of name, age, and year for both students.

To create a C++ program that stores and displays information about students using a class with a member function.

## Software Used

## Theory

In C++, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It allows you to encapsulate data and functions together. A member function is a function that operates on the data members of the class. In this program, we define a Student class with data members such as name, age, and year. We also define a member function mymethod() to display the student's information.

### Key Concepts
<br>
Class: A structure that bundles related variables and functions together.
<br>
Object: An instance of a class.
<br>
Member Function: A function that is defined inside a class and operates on its data members.
<br>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start
<br>
Step 2: Define a class Student with the following data members:
<br>
name: A string to store the student's name.
<br>
age: A float to store the student's age.
<br>
year: An integer to store the student's year of birth.
<br>
Step 3: Create a member function mymethod() in the Student class to display the student's details.
<br>
Step 4: Create two objects of the Student class, S1 and S2.
<br>
Step 5: Assign values to the name, age, and year data members for each object.
<br>
Step 6: Call the mymethod() function for each object to display the values.

## Aim

To create a C++ program that calculates and displays the volume of a cuboid using a class with member functions.

## Software Used

- Dev C++

## Theory

<p>
  In C++, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and encapsulating data and functions together. In this program, we define a Cuboid class with data members such as l (length), w (width), h (height), and volume. We also define member functions to input the dimensions, calculate the volume, and display the result.
</p>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start
<br>
Step 2: Define a class Cuboid with the following data members:
<br>
l: A float to store the length of the cuboid.
<br>
w: A float to store the width of the cuboid.
<br>
h: A float to store the height of the cuboid.
<br>
volume: A float to store the calculated volume.
<br>
Step 3: Create member functions in the Cuboid class:
<br>
input(): To input the dimensions of the cuboid.
<br>
Volume(): To calculate the volume of the cuboid.
<br>
Output(): To display the volume of the cuboid.
<br>
Step 4: Create an object of the Cuboid class.
<br>
Step 5: Call the input() function to get dimensions from the user.
<br>
Step 6: Call the Volume() function to calculate the volume.
<br>
Step 7: Call the Output() function to display the volume.
<br>
Step 8: Stop
